# T20-CRICKET-DATA-ANALYSIS


Using T20 Cricket data I have Data Analytics to build a team of dream 11 players. 

**WEB SCRAPING:**

**ESPNCRICINFO** is a website that provides related information about recently held T20-cricket match in tabular forms : like Score table, Batsman information table, Bowler information table. 

**Bright data is an open-source platform where web scraping tool:** Instead of the traditional method of cut-copy-paste of the required data which becomes very tedious in a large dataset project, we show interest towards the tool that performs web-scraping for us. As such Bright data provides proxy web scrappers that work seamlessley. 
Using the website, created the web collectors that are written in JavaScript to parse and collect that data from the required webpage. 
After the information is scraped, it can be sent it to registered email upon completition. 

**DATA TRANSFORMATION AND DATA CLEANING**
Python provides a huge set of libraries that can be used to clean and transform the data an done such is Pandas library. I have used Pandas library in jupyter notebook to clean and transform the data collected by the web collectors of bright data platform.

Preliminary data insights have been plotted using Matplotlib and seaborn. 

**Using PowerBI,** built an interactive dashboard to generate insights on the best 11 players. Used Power query for further data transformation and DAX for parameter building.
