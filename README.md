# T20-CRICKET-DATA-ANALYSIS


Using T20 Cricket data I have Data Analytics to build a team of dream 11 players. 
• Used web scraping with the help of bright data and scraped T20 data available from espncricinfo website. 
• Data transformation and Data cleaning is achieved with the help of Python, Pandas through Jupyter Notebook. 
• Preliminary data insights have been plotted using Matplotlib and seaborn. 
• Using PowerBI, built an interactive dashboard to generate insights on the best 11 players. Used Power query for further data transformation and DAX for parameter building.
